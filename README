# Capture

Source code for the open-source quick screen grabbing tool Capture, insipired by the now-ad-cluttered gyazo.

## Functions

* Start programme
* Draw rectangle over the place you want to screenshot (as of now, the rectangle is invisible)
* When you release your left mouse button, the screenshot will be saved locally and uploaded to the server
* The URL of the new screenshot will be copied to your clipboard
* The screenshot will be opened in your browser

## Configuration

config.yaml lets you set a few things:

* domain:     (string);     The domain of the remote server to upload the screenshot to
* key:        (string);     A simple API key of the domain
* local_only: (true/false); Only save the screenshot locally, do not upload/open in browser
* copy_link:  (true/false); Copy the URL (or file path if local_only) to the clipboard
* open_link:  (true/false); Open the URL in the browser (only if not local)

## Compilation

This can be compiled to an .exe with py2exe. A preset setup.py as well as **ready precompiled executables are coming soon**.

## Issues

As of right now, Norton 360 seems to see Capture as a security threat when it tries to upload the screenshot to the server, so it deletes/quarantines the executable. Microsoft Security Essentials doesn't do that, I don't know about other anti-viruses yet.

## To-do

* Draw rectangle around the selected area!
* Fix the Norton 360 issue described above somehow
* Create a nice website/service for this tool

## Dependencies

* pywin32
* Python Imaging Library
* pyYAML
